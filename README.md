# Investigate-a-Dataset

### Investigate ‘The Movie Database (TMDb)’

The Movie Database (TMDb) contains information about 10,000 movies including user rating, revenue, cast, genres, etc.

The primary goal of this project is to go through and analyze the dataset using the general data analysis process, doing so using Python libraries such as numpy, pandas and matplotlib. 

### Research Questions
1.	Do movies with higher budgets earn higher revenue? 
2.	Do longer movies bring in more revenue? 
3.	Are longer movies more popular than shorter movies? 
4.	Do movies with bigger budgets have longer runtimes?

### What do you need to install?
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- csv

### The project follows the following steps
1.	Assess the Data: Download and upload the file to workbook.
2.	Data Wrangling: Trimming and cleaning the data e.g. remove unnecessary information such as null and duplicate values. 
3.	Exploratory Data analysis: Study the statistics and create visualizations to analyze relationships between different values.
4.	Communicate the results: Use the above findings to answer questions posed and make conclusions.

### Conclusions
- Do movies with higher budgets earn higher revenue? Because budget and revenue have a positive correlation, we can conclude that movies with higher budgets earn higher revenue.
- Do longer movies bring in more revenue? Longer movies bring in lower revenue. The highest revenue comes in from movies with a length between 100-200 min.
- Are longer movies more popular than shorter movies? Longer movies are not popular, neither are movies that are too short. The most popular movies run between 150-250 minutes.
- Do movies with bigger budgets have longer runtimes? There is a positive correlation between runtime and budget, however, movies that are less than 200 min seem to be assigned the highest budgets. Longer movies do not necessarily have higher budgets than shorter ones.
